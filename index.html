            <p>Hi! I am Edward Kwong. </p>
            <p>As a recent transplant to the UK, I bring with me a decade of experience as a passionate science teacher.
                Guiding young minds through the intricacies of the natural world was my calling. However, fate had other
                plansâ€”a digital metamorphosis awaited.</p>
            <p>
                At Code Academy, I immersed myself in the art of code. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript became my tools of
                expression. I crafted pixel-perfect interfaces, danced with animations, and debugged like a seasoned
                detective. The allure of full stack development beckoned, and I heeded the call.
